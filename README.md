# Industrial-6DOF-Robot-Work
Project Overview

This is an independent project to develop a Digital Twin dashboard for industrial machinery. Currently, a 6DOF CAD model has been created and will be integrated into MATLAB Simulink as a URDF model.

The project aims to simulate the model to analyze torque and forces in each link. The collected data will later be used to develop machine learning models for predictive maintenance and performance optimization.

## Current Progress

6DOF CAD model completed

Preparing URDF conversion for Simulink

Planning torque and force simulation for each link

## Next Steps

Integrate 6DOF CAD model into Simulink as URDF

Simulate to extract torque and force data

Collect and preprocess data for machine learning

Develop the digital twin dashboard for visualization and predictive maintenance

## Usage

Once integrated into Simulink, the model can be simulated to measure forces and torques

Data from simulations will feed into machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance

## Future Features

Real-time monitoring of industrial machinery

Predictive alerts to prevent breakdowns

Dashboard visualization for torque, force, and system performance
